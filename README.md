The aim of this project is to extract topics from the on-line reviews left by users on the Amazon. 
Dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/grikomsn/amazon-cell-phones-reviews, representing the comments from 2003 till September 2019.
I have merged csv cellphones.csv (product info) and the reviews.csv (comments and notes) in one. This initial dataset contained 82815 reviews for a variety of products and brands.
â€¢	I have been in the mobile industry for over 12 years now and seen the change of the mobile devices technology from 2G to 5G. As market players, technologies and services evolving, the expectations of consumers to the mobile phones products also changing. Thus, I was more interested to understand what topics are most common in the comments users left over past 4 years.

I have tried the Topic extraction with Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
